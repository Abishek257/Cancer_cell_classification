Classifying the cancer cells using Machine Learning Algorithms

  Here, we had used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the Kaggle. The dataset contains 569 tumor samples and 30 features including radius, texture, perimeter, and area of tumors. It contains 2 classification labels such Malignant or cancerous (represented by 0) and Benign or non-cancerous (represented by 1). We are using different Machine Learning classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, and LGBM Classifier to classify the cancer cells.

  Finally, the Naives Bayes Classifier performs well with the accuracy of 97.37% compared to other classification models.
